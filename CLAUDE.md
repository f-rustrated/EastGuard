EastGuard = zero-controller messaging system for flexible scalability + high operability. Inspired by LinkedIn's Northguard architecture.

# Code Quality

## Clippy
After every code change, run clippy + fix all errors before task done:
```sh
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```
All warnings = errors (`-D warnings`). No `#[allow(...)]` to suppress legitimate warnings — fix underlying issue. Use `#[allow(dead_code)]` only for code intentionally kept for future use or used only in test targets.
