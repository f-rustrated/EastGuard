# Eastguard Client Layer

This spec defines two client-facing planes:

- Control Plane: topic lifecycle and cluster metadata (create topic, describe topic, list cluster members)
- Data Plane: message produce and consume (write a record, read records by offset, commit consumer position)

Topics and their ranges/segments live in the **Raft-managed control plane** (`MetadataStateMachine`).
Consumer group state (membership, assignments, committed offsets) also goes there via new `MetadataCommand`
variants. The data plane (`DataPlaneActor`, WAL, segment files) stores only message payloads.

## Implementation Phases

**Phase 1 — Client-side offset tracking (current)**

Consumers carry their own read position. Every `Fetch` request includes an explicit `offset` field.
The server is stateless with respect to consumer position. In scope:

- Wire protocol (framing, `request_id`, out-of-order responses)
- Control Plane: `CreateTopic`, `DeleteTopic`, `ListHostedTopics`, `DescribeTopic`
- Data Plane: `Produce`, `Fetch`, `ListOffsets`
- Admin: `DescribeCluster`, `ListHostedTopicsWithStats`, `SplitRange`
- `TopicRoutingCache`, `NotLeader` redirect, `ClientHandler` dispatch

**Phase 2 — Server-side offset tracking (deferred)**

Adds consumer group coordination and durable offset commits. In scope:

- `ConsumerGroup` request variant: `JoinGroup`, `Heartbeat`, `LeaveGroup`
- Data Plane: `CommitOffset`, `FetchCommittedOffset`
- Coordinator, `MetadataStateMachineObserver` (consumer group impl), `ConsumerGroupMeta`
- Offset log design (dedicated segment via DataPlaneActor, rebuilt on coordinator failover)

Phase 1 clients remain wire-compatible with Phase 2 servers — the protocol is additive.

## Connection Model

Connections are persistent. One TCP connection carries many request/response cycles for the lifetime of the
client session. Multiple requests may be in-flight simultaneously (see Wire Protocol below). There is no
handshake or authentication in the initial implementation.

The existing `ClientStreamReader::handle_client_stream()` evolves into this loop.

## Wire Protocol

All frames use the same length-prefix framing already in place, extended with a `request_id`:

```
Request frame:  [len: u32][request_id: u64][ClientRequest payload: N bytes]
Response frame: [len: u32][request_id: u64][ClientResponse payload: N bytes]
```

- `request_id`: client-assigned, monotonically increasing per connection (wraps at `u64::MAX`).
- Responses carry back the same `request_id` — client matches responses to in-flight requests.
- Responses may arrive **out of order** relative to requests. The client must handle this.
- A single connection may have up to `max_in_flight` outstanding requests (configurable, default 256).
  Exceeding this limit: client blocks until a response arrives.

This replaces the current implicit one-at-a-time request/response model.

## Protocol - Request/Response Shape

Top-level dispatch enum (replaces `ConnectionRequests`):

```
ClientRequest:
  ControlPlane(ControlPlaneRequest)   -- Phase 1
  DataPlane(DataPlaneRequest)         -- Phase 1
  ConsumerGroup(ConsumerGroupRequest) -- Phase 2
  Admin(AdminRequest)                 -- Phase 1
```

Error responses are split by plane:

**Control plane errors** — routing is handled server-side; clients never see `NotLeader` or
`ShardNotLocal`. The receiving node resolves the correct leader internally and forwards the request
once (`ProposeRequest { forwarded: true }`). If forwarding fails, `InternalError` is returned.

**Data plane errors** — routing is the client's responsibility via `TopicRoutingCache`.

```
-- Data plane only --

NotLeader { leader_addr: Option<SocketAddr> }
  <- This node is not the segment leader (Produce) or not in the replica_set (Fetch).
     leader_addr: the segment leader's address if known. Client reconnects and retries.

ShardNotLocal { hint_node: SocketAddr }
  <- This node does not host the shard group for the requested topic.
     hint_node: one live shard group member resolved from the local Topology (hash ring).
     Distinct from TopicNotFound: the topic may exist, just not on this node.
     The node distinguishes the two via Topology: hash(topic_name) → ShardGroupId →
     if this node is a member and the topic is absent → TopicNotFound (truly does not exist);
     if this node is not a member → ShardNotLocal.

-- All planes --

StaleGeneration      (Phase 2)
InternalError(String)
```

Client retry policy on `NotLeader`:

- Reconnect to `leader_addr` if provided; otherwise retry current node.
- Exponential backoff: base 50ms, multiplier 2x, jitter ±20%, max 5 000ms.

Client retry policy on `ShardNotLocal`:

- Reconnect to `hint_node` and retry once. If `hint_node` also returns `ShardNotLocal`
  (stale Topology), apply same exponential backoff as `NotLeader`.

## Server-Side Dispatch Architecture

The connection handler is split into a reader task and a writer task. A channel connects them.

```
TcpListener::accept()
        │
        ▼
    read loop (dedicated tokio task)
        │  reads frame → (request_id, ClientRequest)
        │  spawns one handler task per request
        │
        ├── handler task (request_id=1, ControlPlane::CreateTopic)  ─┐
        ├── handler task (request_id=2, DataPlane::Produce)          │ sends (request_id, response)
        ├── handler task (request_id=3, Admin::DescribeCluster)      │ to writer_tx channel
        ...                                                           │
        ▼                                                             │
    write loop (dedicated tokio task) <──────────────────────────────┘
        │  reads (request_id, response) from channel
        │  encodes and writes frame to TCP
```

`ClientHandler` — shared state cloned into each handler task:

```rust
struct ClientHandler {
    node_id: NodeId,
    swim_sender: SwimSender,
    raft_sender: RaftSender,
    data_plane_sender: DataPlaneSender,
    routing_cache: Arc<TopicRoutingCache>,   // per-node, shared across all connections
    writer_tx: mpsc::Sender<(u64, ClientResponse)>,
}
```

Each request variant dispatches to the appropriate sender:

- `ControlPlane` → `raft_sender` (Raft propose or metadata query)
- `DataPlane::Produce` → `routing_cache` lookup → `data_plane_sender`
- `DataPlane::Fetch` / `ListOffsets` → `data_plane_sender`
- `ConsumerGroup` → `raft_sender` (coordinator propose) + `routing_cache` *(Phase 2)*
- `Admin` → `swim_sender` + `raft_sender`

## Control Plane

All writes go through Raft consensus. Routing is handled **server-side** — the client never sees
`NotLeader` or `ShardNotLocal` for control plane operations.

The receiving node resolves the correct shard group leader using the local Topology + `MultiRaft`,
then forwards the request once via `ProposeRequest { forwarded: true }`. Max 1 forwarding hop
(DS-RSM invariant #8). If the forwarded-to node is also not the leader, it returns `InternalError`
rather than forwarding again.

Read-only queries (`ListHostedTopics`, `DescribeTopic`) are served from local `MetadataStateMachine`
state — no Raft proposal. Reads may be stale on followers; this is acceptable for the initial
implementation. Read forwarding routes to any live shard group member (no leader required).

**Implementation note — DRY handover.** The handover pattern recurs across every control plane
handler: compute `ShardGroupId`, check local membership, resolve target (leader for writes, any
member for reads), forward once, handle failure. This logic must be extracted into a shared
helper (e.g. `ControlPlaneRouter`) rather than duplicated per handler.

### Protocols

**CreateTopic**

```
Request:  { name: String, retention_ms: u64, replication_factor: u8 }
Response: Ok | AlreadyExists | InternalError
```

Flow:

1. **Leader resolution (server-side).** Compute `ShardGroupId::new(hash(name))`. Query `MultiRaft`:
   - This node is the leader → continue to step 2.
   - This node hosts the shard group but is a follower → resolve leader via
     `MultiRaft::current_leader`, forward with `ProposeRequest { forwarded: true }`.
   - This node does not host the shard group → pick a live shard group member from local
     Topology, forward with `ProposeRequest { forwarded: true }`.
   - Forwarding fails (no leader known, election in progress) → return `InternalError`.

2. **Duplicate check.** Query `MetadataStateMachine::topic_name_index` for `name`.
   - Found → return `AlreadyExists` (no proposal needed, idempotent).

3. **Propose.** Send `RaftCommand::Metadata(MetadataCommand::CreateTopic { name, retention_ms,
   replication_factor })` to `MultiRaftActor` via oneshot. Await commit.
   - Committed → `MetadataStateMachine` creates topic + initial full-keyspace range + initial
     segment → return `Ok`.
   - `ProposeError::NotLeader` (lost leadership between step 1 and commit) → return `InternalError`.

**DeleteTopic**

```
Request:  { name: String }
Response: Ok | TopicNotFound | InternalError
```

Flow:

1. **Leader resolution (server-side).** Compute `ShardGroupId::new(hash(name))`. Query `MultiRaft`:
   - This node is the leader → continue.
   - This node hosts the shard group but is a follower → forward to leader via
     `ProposeRequest { forwarded: true }`.
   - This node does not host the shard group → pick a live shard group member from Topology,
     forward with `ProposeRequest { forwarded: true }`.
   - Forwarding fails → return `InternalError`.

2. **Existence check.** Query `MetadataStateMachine::topic_name_index` for `name`.
   - Not found → return `TopicNotFound`.

3. **Propose.** Send `RaftCommand::Metadata(MetadataCommand::DeleteTopic { name })` to
   `MultiRaftActor`. Await commit.
   - Committed → `MetadataStateMachine` cascades `Deleting` state to all ranges and segments
     → return `Ok`.
   - `ProposeError::NotLeader` (lost leadership mid-flight) → return `InternalError`.

**ListHostedTopics**

```
Request:  {}
Response: { topics: Vec<TopicSummary { name: String, range_count: u32, state: TopicState }> }
```

Flow:

1. **Local read.** Query local `MetadataStateMachine` for all topics in all hosted shard groups.
   No Raft proposal. May be stale on followers — acceptable for the initial implementation.
2. Return summaries directly. No forwarding, no leader check.

Note: returns only topics whose shard group is hosted on this node. No scatter-gather.
A client wanting a cluster-wide view must query all nodes.

**ListAllTopics** *(deferred — post Phase 1)*

Scatter-gather across all SWIM-known nodes. Deferred: fan-out, partial failure handling, and
timeout semantics add complexity not needed for Phase 1 producers and consumers. Clients requiring
a cluster-wide view can fan out `ListHostedTopics` themselves using the SWIM membership list.

**DescribeTopic**

```
Request:  { name: String }
Response: TopicDetail {
    name: String,
    ranges: Vec<RangeDetail {
        range_id: u64,
        keyspace_start: Vec<u8>,
        keyspace_end: Vec<u8>,
        active_segment_id: Option<u64>,
        state: RangeState,
    }>
} | TopicNotFound
```

Flow:

1. **Shard group check.** Compute `ShardGroupId::new(hash(name))`. Check if this node hosts the
   shard group via `MultiRaft`.
   - Not hosted → pick a live shard group member from Topology, forward request.
     Any member can serve the read — no leader required.
     If forwarding fails → return `InternalError`.

2. **Local read.** Query `MetadataStateMachine::topic_name_index` for `name`.
   - Not found → return `TopicNotFound` (topic genuinely does not exist).

3. **Build response.** Traverse ranges, collect `range_id`, `keyspace_start`, `keyspace_end`,
   `active_segment_id`, `state` for each range. Return `TopicDetail`. No Raft proposal.
   May be stale on followers.

## Data Plane

Data plane writes go to `DataPlaneActor` — an append-only WAL + segment file engine on the local disk.
No Raft involvement for message data.

**Segment leader vs. Raft leader:** These are different roles.

- The **Raft leader** for a shard group manages topic metadata.
- The **segment leader** (`replica_set[0]` in `SegmentMeta`) handles writes for a specific segment.

In all data plane operations, if this node does not host the shard group for the topic at all,
it returns `ShardNotLocal { hint_node }` before any further routing logic runs (see Common Errors).

For `Produce`: the receiving node must be the segment leader. If it hosts the shard group but is
not the segment leader, it returns `NotLeader { leader_addr: segment_leader_addr }` where
`leader_addr` is resolved from the topic routing cache → `replica_set[0]` → SWIM address lookup.

For `Fetch`: any node in `replica_set` can serve reads — followers are valid targets. Followers
track `commit_offset` piggybacked on each `ReplicaAppend` and serve records only up to that
committed position. If the receiving node hosts the shard group but is not in the `replica_set`
for the requested range, it returns `NotLeader { leader_addr: replica_set[0] }`.

### Topic Routing Snapshot Cache

See "Topic Routing Cache" section for the concrete type. Used by all `DataPlane` and `ConsumerGroup`
handlers to resolve `topic_name + routing_key → range → segment → replica_set` without crossing
the actor boundary on every request.

### Protocols

**Produce**

```
Request:  { topic_name: String, routing_key: Vec<u8>, data: Vec<u8>, record_count: u32 }
Response: { entry_id: u64 } | NotLeader | ShardNotLocal | TopicNotFound | RangeSplitting { ... }
```

`data` is a pre-serialized, optionally compressed blob produced by the client. The broker stamps
an `entry_id` and stores, replicates, and serves this payload opaque — it never parses or
re-serializes record contents. `record_count` tells consumers how many records are inside the
blob; the broker forwards it alongside the payload without inspecting it.

`routing_key` is treated as opaque bytes by the server — it is used solely to locate the target
range via `keyspace_start <= routing_key < keyspace_end`. The client owns partitioning strategy:

- **Key-based:** pass `hash(key)` — even distribution across ranges.
- **Sticky:** pass the same fixed bytes per session — all records land in one range.
- **Round-robin / random:** pass a random byte sequence per record.
- **Explicit:** pass a value known to fall in a specific range's keyspace.

No protocol changes are needed to introduce new strategies — the server never inspects the
partitioning intent.

Flow:

1. **Cache lookup.** Look up `topic_name` in the local routing cache.
   - Cache miss → resolve from local metadata state. If the shard group is not hosted on this
     node → return `ShardNotLocal { hint_node }`.
   - Topic absent on the owning node → return `TopicNotFound`.

2. **Range resolution.** Linear scan active ranges (sorted by `keyspace_start`,
   at most ~100 entries) for the first range where `routing_key < keyspace_end`. Retrieve
   `active_segment_id` and `replica_set`.

3. **Segment leader check.** `replica_set[0]` is the segment leader.
   - This node is the segment leader → continue.
   - Not the segment leader → return `NotLeader { leader_addr: replica_set[0] address }`.

4. **Write.** Send append request to the data plane. Await the assigned `entry_id`.
   - Active segment sealed (range split in progress) → invalidate cache entry, return
     `RangeSplitting { left_range_id, right_range_id, split_point }`. Client routes to the
     correct child range:
     `routing_key < split_point` → `left_range_id`, otherwise → `right_range_id`.
   - Committed → return `{ entry_id }`.

Application-level idempotency keys (`producer_id`, `sequence_no`) are embedded inside `data`
by the producer client. The broker does **not** deduplicate — this is an app-level primitive
for exactly-once semantics.

**Fetch**

```
Request:  { topic_name: String, range_id: u64, entry_id: u64, record_index: u32, max_bytes: u32 }
Response: { entries: Vec<Entry>, next_entry_id: u64, range_status: RangeStatus }
        | NotLeader | ShardNotLocal | EntryIdOutOfRange

Entry:    { entry_id: u64, data: Vec<u8>, record_count: u32 }

RangeStatus:
  Active
  Sealed { end_entry_id: u64, transition: RangeTransition }

RangeTransition:
  Split { left_range_id: u64, right_range_id: u64, split_point: Vec<u8> }
  Merged { merged_range_id: u64 }
```

`entry_id` and `record_index` together identify the consumer's read position. `record_index` is
the index of the first record to return within that entry (0 = start of entry). The consumer
tracks position as `(entry_id, record_index)` client-side.

`high_watermark` is intentionally absent from the response — the client polls when `entries` is
empty regardless. Use `ListOffsets` for consumer lag monitoring.

Flow:

1. **Cache lookup.** Look up `topic_name` in the local routing cache. Same miss path as `Produce`
   (`ShardNotLocal` or `TopicNotFound`).

2. **Range lookup.** Retrieve range routing by `range_id` (covers both active and sealed ranges).
   Get `replica_set`.

3. **Replica check.** Any node in `replica_set` may serve reads.
   - This node is in `replica_set` → continue.
   - Not in `replica_set` → return `NotLeader { leader_addr: replica_set[0] address }`.

4. **Read.** Read entries from segment cache/file starting at `entry_id`, up to `max_bytes`. Serve
   only up to `committed_entry_id` (followers track this via piggybacked replication messages).
   - `entry_id > committed_entry_id` → return `EntryIdOutOfRange`.
   - Range is sealed → populate `Sealed { end_entry_id, transition }`.
   - Otherwise → return `entries` with `range_status: Active`.
   - `next_entry_id`: if `entries` is non-empty, `last_entry.entry_id + 1`; if empty, the
     requested `entry_id` unchanged. Only present on success.

**Client transition logic:**

*Split* — consumer receives `Sealed { end_entry_id: E, Split { left: L, right: RR, split_point: SP } }`:
1. Drain range R to `end_entry_id` E (may require additional Fetch calls if `max_bytes` was small).
2. Open two new Fetch streams: `Fetch(L, entry_id=0, record_index=0)` and `Fetch(RR, entry_id=0, record_index=0)`.
3. Process L and RR independently.

*Merge* — consumer tracks both source ranges L and RR. Each eventually returns
`Sealed { end_entry_id, Merged { merged_range_id: M } }`:
1. Drain L to its `end_entry_id`. Mark L done.
2. Drain RR to its `end_entry_id`. Mark RR done.
3. Only after both are done → open one new Fetch stream from M at `entry_id=0, record_index=0`.

The consumer naturally sees both sealed events because it tracks all active ranges of a topic.
No extra metadata query is needed to coordinate the merge.

**ListOffsets**

```
Request:  { topic_name: String, range_id: u64 }
Response: { start_entry_id: u64, committed_entry_id: u64 } | NotLeader | ShardNotLocal
```

`committed_entry_id`: the `entry_id` of the last entry replicated and committed — one past this
is the next entry to be written. Consumers use `committed_entry_id - current_entry_id` to
calculate lag.

Flow:

1. **Cache lookup.** Same miss path as `Fetch` step 1 (`ShardNotLocal` or `TopicNotFound`).
2. **Replica check.** Any node in `replica_set` may serve — same check as `Fetch` step 3.
   - Not in `replica_set` → return `NotLeader { leader_addr: replica_set[0] address }`.
3. **Read.** Return `start_entry_id` (first entry of the range) and `committed_entry_id` from
   local segment state. No disk I/O needed.

**CommitOffset** *(Phase 2)*

```
Request:  { consumer_group: String, topic_name: String, range_id: u64,
            entry_id: u64, record_index: u32, generation_id: u32 }
Response: Ok | StaleGeneration | NotLeader
```

Consumer position `(entry_id, record_index)` is written to the dedicated offset log by the
coordinator. The coordinator validates `generation_id` before writing. Non-coordinators return
`NotLeader { leader_addr: coordinator_addr }`. Committed offsets are NOT Raft-proposed — they
go directly to the offset log segment.

**FetchCommittedOffset** *(Phase 2)*

```
Request:  { consumer_group: String, topic_name: String, range_id: u64 }
Response: { entry_id: Option<u64>, record_index: Option<u32> } | NotLeader
```

Read-only query against the coordinator's in-memory offset map (rebuilt from the offset log on
failover). Must route to the coordinator (Raft leader) — followers do not maintain this map.
Returns `None` fields if no offset has been committed for this group/range yet.

## Topic Routing Cache

Shared per-node across all connections. Populated on first use per topic, invalidated on topology
changes (range split, merge).

```rust
pub struct TopicRoutingCache {
    inner: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, Arc<TopicRouting>>>>,
}

pub struct TopicRouting {
    pub topic_id: TopicId,
    pub shard_group_id: ShardGroupId,
    // Active ranges sorted by keyspace_start — linear scanned on Produce.
    pub active_ranges: Vec<RangeRouting>,
    // All ranges (active + sealed) keyed by range_id — used by Fetch.
    pub all_ranges: HashMap<RangeId, RangeRouting>,
}

pub struct RangeRouting {
    pub range_id: RangeId,
    pub keyspace_start: Vec<u8>,
    pub keyspace_end: Vec<u8>,
    pub active_segment_id: Option<SegmentId>,
    pub replica_set: Vec<NodeId>,  // [0] = segment leader
}
```

**Invalidation**: `MetadataStateMachineObserver` (see Consumer Group section) fires on `RangeSplit`
and `RangeMerge`. The cache entry for the affected topic is removed. The next Produce/Fetch for that
topic triggers a rebuild via a new `MultiRaftActorCommand::GetTopicRouting { topic_name, reply }` query.

**Rebuild query path**: `GetTopicRouting` asks `MultiRaft` for the topic's active ranges and all
segments' replica sets from the local `MetadataStateMachine`. The result is cached until the next
invalidation.

## Admin API

Implemented early for testability. Admin handlers query local state only — no Raft proposals.

### Protocols

**DescribeCluster**

```
Request:  {}
Response: { nodes: Vec<NodeInfo { node_id: String, addr: SocketAddr, state: NodeState }> }

NodeState: Alive | Suspect | Dead
```

Flow:

1. **Query SWIM.** Send `SwimQueryCommand` to `swim_sender` to retrieve the current membership
   table.
2. **Build response.** Map each known node to `NodeInfo { node_id, addr, state }`. `state`
   reflects this node's local SWIM view — may differ from other nodes' views during a partition.
   Return directly. No Raft proposal, no forwarding, no leader check.

**ListHostedTopicsWithStats**

```
Request:  {}
Response: { topics: Vec<TopicStats { name: String, range_count: u32,
                                     total_records: u64, total_bytes: u64 }> }
```

Flow:

1. **Local read.** Query local `MetadataStateMachine` for all topics across all hosted shard groups.
2. **Aggregate stats.** For each topic, iterate all `SegmentMeta` entries and sum `size_bytes`
   and record counts. Local shard groups only — no scatter-gather.
3. **Return.** No Raft proposal, no forwarding, no leader check.

**SplitRange**

```
Request:  { topic_name: String, range_id: u64, split_point: Vec<u8> }
Response: Ok | InvalidSplitPoint | InternalError
```

Implementation note: `MetadataCommand::SplitRange` and `MetadataStateMachine::split_range()` are
fully implemented (`src/clusters/metadata/command.rs`, `state_machine.rs`). The handler only
needs to wire up to the existing logic — no new state machine code required. `InvalidSplitPoint`
is already returned by `split_range()` for boundary violations.

Flow:

1. **Leader resolution (server-side).** Compute `ShardGroupId::new(hash(topic_name))`. Same
   forwarding logic as `CreateTopic` — resolve leader via Topology + `MultiRaft`, forward once
   with `ProposeRequest { forwarded: true }`. Forwarding failure → return `InternalError`.

2. **Validate split point.** Check `split_point` is strictly interior to the range's keyspace:
   `keyspace_start < split_point < keyspace_end`. If not → return `InvalidSplitPoint`.

3. **Propose.** Send `RaftCommand::Metadata(MetadataCommand::SplitRange { topic_name, range_id,
   split_point })` to `MultiRaftActor`. Await commit.
   - Committed → `MetadataStateMachine::split_range()` seals parent range, creates two child
     ranges → return `Ok`.
   - `ProposeError::NotLeader` (lost leadership mid-flight) → return `InternalError`.

## Consumer Group *(Phase 2)*

Single-consumer end-to-end is proven first. Consumer group coordination is added as a layer on top.

Multiple consumer instances share a topic without duplicate processing. Instance A consumes ranges
1–3, instance B consumes ranges 4–6. When A dies, B takes over A's ranges starting from A's last
committed offset.

### Generation ID

`generation_id` is a monotonically incrementing counter on `ConsumerGroupMeta`. It increments on
every rebalance event:

- Member joins
- Member leaves (voluntary or crash-detected via heartbeat timeout)
- Range split or merge creates new range assignments

**Purpose — fencing stale consumers.** A consumer that missed a rebalance (network partition,
GC pause, etc.) still holds an old `generation_id`. Every `CommitOffset` and `Heartbeat` carries
the consumer's current `generation_id`. If it doesn't match the group's current `generation_id`:

- `CommitOffset` is rejected with `StaleGeneration`
- `HeartbeatResponse` carries `GroupEvent::StaleGeneration`

The consumer then calls `JoinGroup` again to get a fresh `generation_id` and updated assignments.
This prevents split-brain: a consumer that missed a rebalance cannot commit offsets for ranges it
no longer owns.

### Client Connection Model (Phase 2)

Consumers maintain two logical connections to different nodes:

```
Consumer
  ├── read connection  → any replica in replica_set  (Fetch, ListOffsets)
  └── commit connection → coordinator (Raft leader)  (CommitOffset, FetchCommittedOffset,
                                                       JoinGroup, Heartbeat, LeaveGroup)
```

`CommitOffset` and `FetchCommittedOffset` sent to a non-coordinator node return
`NotLeader { leader_addr: coordinator_addr }`. The consumer reconnects and retries on the
commit connection. The read connection to a follower is unaffected.

Consumer group state is co-located with the topic's metadata shard group. `hash(topic_name)`
routes all consumer group operations to the same shard leader that owns the topic — no
cross-shard coordination is needed.

### Coordinator

The consumer group coordinator is the Raft leader of the shard group that owns the topic metadata.
Coordinator state (group membership, range assignments, `generation_id`, committed offsets) is stored
in `MetadataStateMachine` via Raft.

The coordinator registers as a `MetadataStateMachineObserver` and receives callbacks after each
committed state machine transition. On a `RangeSplit` or `RangeMerge` event, the coordinator
immediately runs the assignment algorithm to update affected members.

**Heartbeat timeout**: configurable via `consumer_heartbeat_timeout_ms` (default: 30 000ms).
The coordinator tracks `last_heartbeat: Instant` per member locally (not Raft-replicated — ephemeral,
rebuilt as members heartbeat to the new leader after failover). A periodic ticker (every 5s) checks
all members; members exceeding the timeout are declared dead and their ranges redistributed.

### MetadataStateMachineObserver

Registered with `MultiRaft`. Called after each `apply_committed_entries()` iteration.

The trait itself is Phase 1 (used by `TopicRoutingCache` for invalidation on `RangeSplit`/`RangeMerged`).
The consumer group coordinator implementation of this trait is Phase 2.

```rust
pub trait MetadataStateMachineObserver: Send + Sync {
    fn on_applied(&self, shard_group_id: ShardGroupId, event: &MetadataApplyEvent);
}

pub enum MetadataApplyEvent {
    TopicCreated { topic_id: TopicId, name: String },
    TopicDeleted { topic_id: TopicId },
    RangeSplit { topic_id: TopicId, parent: RangeId, left: RangeId, right: RangeId },
    RangeMerged { topic_id: TopicId, left: RangeId, right: RangeId, merged: RangeId },
    SegmentRolled { topic_id: TopicId, range_id: RangeId },
    ConsumerGroupUpdated { group_id: String, topic_id: TopicId },
}
```

`MultiRaft` holds `Option<Arc<dyn MetadataStateMachineObserver>>`. Set once at node startup before
the actor loop starts. The coordinator component (consumer group manager) implements this trait.

The `TopicRoutingCache` also implements `MetadataStateMachineObserver` to invalidate on
`RangeSplit` and `RangeMerged`. Both observers can be composed (e.g., a `Vec` of observers or a
fan-out wrapper).

### Consumer Group State

Stored in `MetadataStateMachine`. New types alongside existing topic/range/segment types:

```rust
pub struct ConsumerGroupMeta {
    pub group_id: String,
    pub topic_id: TopicId,
    pub generation_id: u32,
    // member_id -> assigned range IDs
    pub members: HashMap<String, Vec<RangeId>>,
    // committed offset per range (group-level, not per-member)
    pub committed_offsets: HashMap<RangeId, u64>,
}
```

New `MetadataCommand` variants:

```rust
JoinConsumerGroup {
group_id:  String,
topic_id:  TopicId,
member_id: String,
joined_at: u64,
}

LeaveConsumerGroup {
group_id:  String,
member_id: String,
}

AssignRanges {
group_id:      String,
topic_id:      TopicId,
assignments:   HashMap<String, Vec<RangeId> >,  // member_id -> ranges
generation_id: u32,
}

CommitConsumerOffset {
group_id:      String,
topic_id:      TopicId,
range_id:      RangeId,
offset:        u64,
generation_id: u32,
}
```

`CommitConsumerOffset` is validated against `ConsumerGroupMeta.generation_id` inside
`MetadataStateMachine::apply()`. Stale-generation commits are rejected with `MetadataError::StaleGeneration`.

### Protocols

**JoinGroup**

```
Request:  { group_id: String, topic_name: String, member_id: Option<String> }
Response: { member_id: String, generation_id: u32,
            assigned_ranges: Vec<{ range_id: u64, start_offset: u64 }> }
```

First join: `member_id = None`. Coordinator proposes `JoinConsumerGroup` with a new UUID member ID,
then `AssignRanges` (increments `generation_id`).
Rejoin (after `StaleGeneration`): pass existing `member_id`. Coordinator looks up existing assignments
or re-runs the algorithm if membership changed while the member was gone.

`start_offset`: the group's last committed offset for that range, or 0 if never committed.

**Heartbeat**

```
Request:  { group_id: String, member_id: String, generation_id: u32 }
Response: { events: Vec<GroupEvent> }
```

`GroupEvent` is one of:

- `AssignRange { range_id: u64, start_offset: u64 }`: start consuming from `start_offset`
- `RevokeRange { range_id: u64 }`: stop consuming immediately
- `StaleGeneration`: call `JoinGroup` again

Empty `events` = all is well, keep heartbeating.

**LeaveGroup**

```
Request: { group_id: String, member_id: String }
```

Fire-and-forget. Coordinator proposes `LeaveConsumerGroup` + `AssignRanges` (re-distributes
the leaving member's ranges to surviving members, increments `generation_id`).

### Assignment Algorithm

**On join**

1. If group has no members → assign all active ranges to the new member.
2. If group is stable → find member with most assigned ranges → steal one → assign to new member
   via `AssignRanges` proposal.
3. If all existing members have exactly one range and topic has only one active range →
   register new member with empty assignment. When the range auto-splits (coordinator gets
   `RangeSplit` callback), immediately run the steal algorithm and deliver `AssignRange` to the
   waiting member via next heartbeat.

**On leave / crash (heartbeat timeout)**

1. Dead member's ranges are distributed round-robin to surviving members (least-loaded first).
2. For each reassigned range, coordinator reads the last committed offset from
   `ConsumerGroupMeta.committed_offsets` and includes it in the `AssignRange` event.

**On RangeSplit**

Coordinator receives `MetadataApplyEvent::RangeSplit { parent, left, right }`.

1. Find the member that owned `parent`.
2. Revoke `parent` from that member via next heartbeat (`RevokeRange { range_id: parent }`).
3. Assign `left` to the original owner (continuity) and `right` to the least-loaded member.
   If only one member exists, assign both to that member.
4. `start_offset` for both children: 0 (children always start fresh).
5. Increment `generation_id` and propose `AssignRanges`.

**On RangeMerge**

Coordinator receives `MetadataApplyEvent::RangeMerged { left, right, merged }`.

1. `left` and `right` may be owned by different members. Revoke both via next heartbeat.
2. Assign `merged` to whichever member had fewer total ranges before (or the owner of `left`
   as tiebreaker).
3. `start_offset` for `merged`: 0 (merged range always starts fresh at offset 0).
4. Members draining source ranges: they continue consuming sealed `left`/`right` to their
   `end_offset`, then transition to `merged` starting at 0.
5. Increment `generation_id` and propose `AssignRanges`.

**Algorithm replaceability**

The assignment logic is behind a trait. Round-robin leave distribution and work-stealing joins are
the default implementation. Swapping to a different strategy (rack-aware, sticky) requires only a
new impl, no protocol changes.

**Exactly-Once Semantics**

Delivery is at-least-once. When a range moves from consumer A to consumer B:

- B starts from A's last committed position
- Entries A fetched but did not commit are re-delivered to B
- `generation_id` fencing ensures A cannot commit after losing the range

Applications requiring exactly-once deduplicate using idempotency keys embedded inside the entry
payload by the producer client. The broker does not deduplicate.

## Consumer Offset Storage *(Phase 2)*

Committed positions are Raft-replicated via `MetadataCommand::CommitConsumerOffset`. This means:

- Positions survive coordinator (Raft leader) failover — the new leader picks up from persisted state.
- `CommitOffset` latency = Raft round-trip (~1s typical at the current heartbeat interval).
  For high-throughput consumers, batch position commits (commit every N entries or every T ms).
- The `MetadataStateMachine` stores `committed_positions: HashMap<RangeId, (entry_id, record_index)>`
  inside `ConsumerGroupMeta`. The position is per-group per-range (not per-member) — when a range is
  reassigned, the new owner picks up from the group's last committed position.

**Commit flow**:

```
Consumer → CommitOffset(group, topic, range, entry_id, record_index, generation_id)
    → Server: validate generation_id matches ConsumerGroupMeta.generation_id
    → Server: Raft propose CommitConsumerOffset
    → On commit: MetadataStateMachine updates committed_positions[range_id] = (entry_id, record_index)
    → Server: respond Ok
```

**Fetch committed offset**: read-only query against local `MetadataStateMachine`. Any node can serve
it (may be stale on followers, acceptable for consumer recovery). Returns `None` fields if no
position has been committed for this group/range.

## Client Routing

Clients connect to any seed node. The server handles redirect via `NotLeader { leader_addr }`.

**Client-side routing cache**

- `HashMap<TopicName, TopicPartitionInfo>` is populated from `DescribeTopic` responses.
- Invalidates on `NotLeader` for that topic → fresh `DescribeTopic` before retry.
- Retry policy: up to 3 attempts, 50ms base backoff, 2x multiplier, ±20% jitter.
  If all 3 fail, surface error to caller.

## Implementation Plan (Phase 1)

### PR 1 — Wire Protocol + Server Dispatch Scaffold

Foundation. All subsequent PRs depend on this.

- [x] Extend frame format: `[len: u32][request_id: u64][payload: N bytes]` for both request and response
- [x] Define `ClientRequest` enum: `ControlPlane(ControlPlaneRequest)`, `DataPlane(DataPlaneRequest)`, `Admin(AdminRequest)`
- [x] Define `ClientResponse` enum: `ControlPlane(ControlPlaneResponse)`, `DataPlane(DataPlaneResponse)`, `Admin(AdminResponse)` + shared error variants (`InternalError`, `NotLeader`, `ShardNotLocal`)
- [ ] Split connection handler into reader task + writer task connected by `mpsc::Sender<(u64, ClientResponse)>`
  - Reader task: reads `(request_id, ClientRequest)` frames, spawns one handler task per request
  - Writer task: reads `(request_id, ClientResponse)` from channel, encodes and writes frames
- [ ] Introduce `ClientHandler` struct (cloned into each handler task):
  ```rust
  struct ClientHandler {
      node_id: NodeId,
      swim_sender: SwimSender,
      raft_sender: RaftSender,
      data_plane_sender: DataPlaneSender,
      routing_cache: Arc<TopicRoutingCache>,
      writer_tx: mpsc::Sender<(u64, ClientResponse)>,
  }
  ```
- [ ] Replace `ConnectionRequests` / `ClientStreamWriter::dispatch()` with new `ClientHandler::dispatch(request_id, ClientRequest)`
- [ ] Stub all request variants with `todo!()` so it compiles; remove stubs as PRs 2–5 land

### PR 2 — Admin API

Read-only handlers. No routing cache, no Raft proposals. Validates the dispatch pattern from PR 1.

- [ ] `Admin::DescribeCluster` — query SWIM membership table, map to `Vec<NodeInfo { node_id, addr, state }>`
- [ ] `Admin::ListHostedTopicsWithStats` — read all topics from local `MetadataStateMachine`, aggregate `size_bytes` and record counts per topic
- [ ] `Admin::SplitRange` — wire `ControlPlaneRouter` leader resolution to existing `MetadataCommand::SplitRange` (already implemented in `state_machine.rs`)

### PR 3 — Control Plane + `ControlPlaneRouter`

Writes through Raft. Introduces the DRY server-side routing helper.

- [ ] Implement `ControlPlaneRouter` helper:
  - Compute `ShardGroupId::new(hash(name))`
  - If this node is leader → return `Local`
  - If this node hosts the shard group but is follower → resolve leader via `MultiRaft::current_leader`, forward once with `ProposeRequest { forwarded: true }`
  - If this node does not host the shard group → pick a live member from local `Topology`, forward once
  - If forwarding fails → `InternalError`
- [ ] `ControlPlane::CreateTopic` — duplicate check via `topic_name_index`, then propose `MetadataCommand::CreateTopic`; return `Ok | AlreadyExists | InternalError`
- [ ] `ControlPlane::DeleteTopic` — existence check, then propose `MetadataCommand::DeleteTopic`; return `Ok | TopicNotFound | InternalError`
- [ ] `ControlPlane::ListHostedTopics` — local read from `MetadataStateMachine`, no leader check; return `Vec<TopicSummary>`
- [ ] `ControlPlane::DescribeTopic` — shard group check (forward to any member if not hosted), local read; return `TopicDetail | TopicNotFound`

### PR 4 — `TopicRoutingCache` + `MetadataStateMachineObserver`

Infrastructure required by the Data Plane. No I/O handlers.

- [ ] Define `MetadataStateMachineObserver` trait:
  ```rust
  pub trait MetadataStateMachineObserver: Send + Sync {
      fn on_applied(&self, shard_group_id: ShardGroupId, event: &MetadataApplyEvent);
  }
  ```
- [ ] Define `MetadataApplyEvent` enum: `TopicCreated`, `TopicDeleted`, `RangeSplit`, `RangeMerged`, `SegmentRolled`
- [ ] Wire observer call into `MultiRaft::apply_committed_entries()` — emit event after each applied entry
- [ ] Add `Option<Arc<dyn MetadataStateMachineObserver>>` to `MultiRaft`; set once at node startup
- [ ] Implement `TopicRoutingCache`:
  ```rust
  pub struct TopicRoutingCache {
      inner: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, Arc<TopicRouting>>>>,
  }
  ```
  - `get_or_fetch(topic_name)` — cache hit returns `Arc<TopicRouting>`; miss sends `GetTopicRouting` to `MultiRaft` and inserts result
  - `invalidate(topic_name)` — removes entry; triggered by `RangeSplit` / `RangeMerged` observer events
- [ ] Add `MultiRaftActorCommand::GetTopicRouting { topic_name, reply: oneshot::Sender<Option<TopicRouting>> }` — read-only query against local `MetadataStateMachine`, no Raft proposal
- [ ] Wire `TopicRoutingCache` as the `MetadataStateMachineObserver` (invalidates on `RangeSplit` / `RangeMerged`)

### PR 5 — Data Plane

Builds on routing cache from PR 4.

- [ ] `DataPlane::Produce`:
  - Cache lookup → `ShardNotLocal` or `TopicNotFound` on miss
  - Range resolution: linear scan `active_ranges` by `routing_key`
  - Segment leader check: `replica_set[0]` must be this node, else `NotLeader { leader_addr }`
  - Write to `DataPlaneActor`; on sealed segment → invalidate cache, return `RangeSplitting { left_range_id, right_range_id, split_point }`
  - Return `{ offset }` on success
- [ ] `DataPlane::Fetch`:
  - Cache lookup → `ShardNotLocal` or `TopicNotFound` on miss
  - Range lookup by `range_id` from `all_ranges` (covers sealed ranges)
  - Replica check: this node must be in `replica_set`, else `NotLeader { leader_addr: replica_set[0] }`
  - Read up to `commit_offset`; `offset > commit_offset` → `OffsetOutOfRange`
  - If range sealed → populate `Sealed { end_offset, transition }` from `MetadataStateMachine`
  - Return `{ records, next_offset, range_status }`
- [ ] `DataPlane::ListOffsets`:
  - Cache lookup → same miss path as `Fetch`
  - Replica check (any `replica_set` member may serve)
  - Return `{ start_offset, commit_offset }` from local segment state; no disk I/O
